# Derivatives Contracts

## What is a Derivative?

> "A derivative is a contract between two or more parties whose value is based on an agreed-upon underlying financial asset"

A derivative is anything that Alice and Bob can agree upon when they financialize an underlying asset. You can do this with anything: corn, housing, cars, and (critically) Bitcoin/Crypto.

## What is a Forward Contract?

A user received 1 bitcoin. The price of bitcoin is 10,000.00 USD. The user elects to keep the USD amount stable, for 1 month, regardless of the price of bitcoin in USD. The user immediately enters an agreement with a 3rd party to pay 1 bitcoin in 1 month in exchange for 10,000.00 USD. (The price of 1 bitcoin on the agreement would likely be different than the current price of bitcoin, but it would be related so keeping numbers simple for now.)
After a month the user exchanges the bitcoin and receives 10,000.00 USD, regardless of the price of bitcoin, as that was the agreement. If the price of bitcoin is 11,000.00 USD, our user lost the opportunity to make a 1,000.00 USD gain. If the price of bitcoin is 9,000.00 USD, our user avoided the 1,000.00 USD loss.

## What is a Futures (Swap) Contract?

A futures contract is a legal agreement to buy or sell a particular [bitcoin] commodity asset at a predetermined [USD] price at a specified time in the future.

The buyer of a futures contract is taking on the obligation to buy and receive the underlying asset when the futures contract expires. The seller of the futures contract is taking on the obligation to provide and deliver the underlying asset at the expiration date.

## What is an Inverse Futures Contract?

A futures contract where the commodity asset has been swapped with the settlement currency. In opposition to the standard futures definition above: a legal agreement to buy or sell a particular [USD] "commodity asset" at a predetermined [bitcoin] price at a specified time in the future.

## What is a Perpetual Swap Contract?

A perpetual futures contract, also known as a perpetual swap, is an agreement to non-optionally buy or sell an asset at an unspecified point in the future. Perpetual futures are cash-settled, and differ from regular futures in that they lack a pre-specified delivery date, and can thus be held indefinitely without the need to roll over contracts as they approach expiration. Payments are periodically exchanged between holders of the two sides of the contracts, long and short, with the direction and magnitude of the settlement based on the difference between the contract price and that of the underlying asset, as well as, if applicable, the difference in leverage between the two sides.

## So What is a Perpetual Inverse Swap Contract, the Derivative We'll Use to Hedge Our Bitcoin to Create Synth USD?

A perpetual inverse swap contract is when you short (bet that the price will go down) on a perpetual swap.

OKX offers both coin-margined and USDT-margined perpetual swaps for various cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, LTC, and more.
OKX perpetual swaps are typically settled daily, but with the introduction of the Unified Account feature, the platform has started offering real-time settlement for perpetual swaps, futures, and options contracts. Trading on OKX incurs trading fees, and users are encouraged to review the trading fees explainer for more information.

## Derivatives Allow You to HEDGE RISK

If you do business in Bitcoin you are inherently LONG bitcoin. You are taking the risk, in USD terms, that the price of bitcoin will go up or down.

"Hedging" with a derivative allows you to LOCK IN the price of bitcoin at a specific USD value, removing that price risk.

You're not selling bitcoin, you're using a financial product to lock the USD price of that bitcoin via a hedge.
